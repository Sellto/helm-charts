## Prerequisites
- Kubernetes 1.12+
- Helm 3.1.0

## Install Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

To install Helm, refer to the [Helm install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) and ensure that the `helm` binary is in the `PATH` of your `SHELL`.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add ittrident https://ittrident.github.io/helm-charts

```

You can then run `helm search repo ittrident` to list the charts.
